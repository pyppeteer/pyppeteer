# Contribution guidelines

Contributions are welcome as long as they follow core rule of the project:

The API of pyppeteer2 should __match the api of puppeteer__[1] as closely as possible withouth sacrificing python too much.  
i.e. keep public api keywords such as method names, arguments, class names etc. as they are in puppeteer version.  

Other than that the contributions should remain as pythonic as possible and pass linting and code tests.
